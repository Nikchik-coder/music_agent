"""
This script is used to authenticate with SoundCloud and get the access token and refresh token.
First you need to get auth_code. For this constract the link with your client id and redirect uri.
Redirect uri can be localhost or any other uri doesnt matter.
Than follow the link and after authorizing you will get the auth_code by following redirect uri.
Uri example:
https://soundcloud.com/connect?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_type=code
