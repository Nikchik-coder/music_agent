I mean snow\nThis is more than motion, this a state of mind\nLeave the mundane world and all its weight behind\nAlive in the velocity, cutting through the air\nA solitary freedom, beyond all compare\n\n(Verse 2)\nThe pines are dusted white now, a monochromatic vibe\nThe silence of the mountain is where my thoughts subscribe\nDropping in is like a needle on a fresh vinyl track\nA fast-paced rhythm, there ain't no holding back\nGot that Southern ambition, aiming for the sun\nBut I'm doing it at sub-zero, 'til the run is done\nEvery edge I catch is a hi-hat, sharp and quick\nThis that cloud rap reality, a weightless, stylish trick\n\n(Bridge)\nUp here, hanging in the atmosphere, it's so serene\nJust the sound of my own breathing, a quiet, focused scene\nThe city's just a flicker, a distant, hazy light\nIn this kingdom of the cold, I own the day and night\n\n(Chorus)\nThis that Frostbite Flow, razor sharp and clean\nA psychedelic landscape, a cinematic scene\nHit a tamedog backflip, watch the world invert\nFloating on a trap beat, kicking up the dirt... I mean snow\nThis is more than motion, this a state of mind\nLeave the mundane world and all its weight behind\nAlive in the velocity, cutting through the air\nA solitary freedom, beyond all compare\n\n(Outro)\nYeah... Ice cold\nJust that Frostbite Flow...\nFrom the top to the bottom...\nA$AP... gone.",
